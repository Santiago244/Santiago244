## HI EVERYONE ‚úã My full name is Cesar Santiago Gonzalez Cuellar.
- I am a student of Telecommunications Engineering at UNIZA, University of Zilina in Slovakia. I have done an **IT Support Specialist** üñ•Ô∏è Google Course from Coursera, and I have finished the **CS50's Introduction To Computer Science** from HarvardX. 
- I am finishing CS50AI (Artificial Intelligence) and CS50P (Python) to understand how AI, along with Python, essentially works. I have been learning English since I was 14, and I worked as a Customer Service Representative, providing support to several product and service-focused campaigns from the United States.
  
- #### The purpose of this GitHub Profile is to showcase my projects, allowing me to demonstrate my experience with various projects on which I've worked.

- The purpose is to understand my hard skills. You will see some projects, like _my personal page_ and a _Landing Page_, which I cloned from Frontendmentors (Website with Projects To Do).
 
- It's noteworthy that projects with JavaScript will be based on **Full-stack Applications**, which for me as a beginner will be so handy and likely are going to make me dive into the topics or frameworks **(React)‚öõÔ∏è**.
- 

#### Now I am HANDS-ON. Other interests of mine are:

- I am looking to collaborate with WEB3(Threejs) and Blockchain ‚õìÔ∏è Projects, also I am excited about Airspace üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Engineering and Physics ‚öõ Stuff as well, those are maybe the topics I used to dive into in my free time.
- I am open to discussions about those, as well as to participate in open-source projects in these fields.

My professional website describes some of my abilities in fields where I develop my skills. Additionally, it will have a personal page that will have articles about the topics I like.
